# Transposed coral data from 'read data.R', ready for co-occurrence analysis.
# presence/absence alternative
t_coral2 <- t_coral[,-1] # can't include morph when converting to presence/absence
t_coral2[t_coral2>0] <- 1 # presence/absence matrix
t_coral2 <-
  t_coral2 %>%
  add_column(t_coral[,1]) %>%
  relocate(morph)

# co-occur coral morphs -----

co_morphs <- print(cooccur(t_coral2[,-1], spp_names = T))


### nodes ----
nodes <- data.frame(id = 1:nrow(t_coral2),
                    label = t_coral2$morph,
                    color = "#606482",
                    shadow = T)

# The edges df needs at least 2 columns, from and to, which should correspond with the ids from the nodes df. Since we used cooccur's numeric labels as our ids, we can use sp1 as our 'from' col and 'sp2' as our to column. (Since our network isn't directed, we could reverse these and it wouldn't matter.) We'll then add some color so our edges match our nodes such that we'll have a lighter color for co-occurrences that occur at a lower frequency than expected and a darker color for co-occurrences that occur at a hither frequency. To make the distinction between 'hither' and 'lower' even more obvious, we'll also specify that co-occurrences tha are lower than expected have a dashed line.

### edges -----
# edges df from the significant pairwise co-occurrences
edges <- data.frame(from = co_morphs$sp1, to = co_morphs$sp2,
                    color = ifelse(co_morphs$p_lt <= 0.05, "red", "#3C3F51"),
                    dashes = ifelse(co_morphs$p_lt <= 0.05, TRUE, FALSE))

### add sp names ----
# not done! co_all <-
  co_all_base %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  left_join(., y = spp, join_by(sp1 == sp_number)) %>%
  left_join(., y = spp, join_by(sp2 == sp_number)) %>%
  select(-(c(sp1_name, sp2_name))) %>%
  rename(sp1_name = species.x, sp2_name = species.y)


### network plot -----
# now visualize the thing
visNetwork(nodes = nodes, edges = edges) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_kk")

# To save the network
cooccur <-
  visNetwork(nodes = nodes, edges = edges) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_kk") %>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE, nodesIdSelection = TRUE,
             manipulation = TRUE) %>% visLegend()
cooccur %>%
  visSave(file = "output/cooc_morph.html")

# example w 2 spp -----
# https://thatdarndata.com/understanding-species-co-occurrence/
# define number of sites
N <- 4
# define number of sites occupied by sp 1
n1 <- 2
# define number of sites occupied by sp 2
n2 <- 2
# number of sites spp 1 and 2 co-occur
j <- 1

# prob that spp 1 and 2 occur at exactly 1 site
choose(N, j) * choose(N - j, n2 - j) * choose(N - n2, n1 - j)/(choose(N, n2) * choose(N, n1))

# assessing species co-occurrence significance
# define number of sites
N <- 30
# define number of sites occupied by sp 1
n1 <- 10
# define number of sites occupied by sp 2
n2 <- 25
# number of sites spp 1 and 2 co-occur
j <- max(0, n1 + n2 - N):min(n1, n2)

# prob that spp 1 and 2 occur at exactly j sites
pj <- choose(N, j) * choose(N - j, n2 - j) * choose(N - n2, n1 - j)/(choose(N, n2) * choose(N, n1))
# show table for j, pj, and the cumulative distribution
round(data.frame(j, pj, sumPj = cumsum(pj)), 4)

# expected number of co-occurrences
sum(pj * j)

# The probability of the two lizard species randomly co-occurring at 6 sites or less is 0.0312 (p5 + p6). Assuming a significance level of 0.05, we can conclude the two lizard species occur less frequently than expected by chance. On the other hand, the probability of the two lizard species co-occurring at 6 sites or more is 0.9982 (p6 + p7 + p8 + p9 + p10 or 1 â€“ p5). Additionally, the expected co-occurrence is 8 sites.

# how do you extend this to multiple pairs of spp? use package cooccur
# see https://thatdarndata.com/how-to-create-co-occurrence-networks-with-the-r-packages-cooccur-and-visnetwork/

# co-occurrence networks ----
# example uses the finches data set from the 'cooccur' package
# begins w presence-absence data...no abundance needed

# load data
data(finches)
head(finches)
dim(finches)

# find significant pairwise co-occurrences
library(tictoc)
tic()
co <- print(cooccur(finches, spp_names = T))
toc()
# interpreting the output: each row represents a significant interaction. In the first column, sp1, we see the numeric label associated with the first species (species 1) of each interaction. This numeric label aligns with the spp order in the data frame. For ex, since the first row in the finches data set is "Geospiza magnirostris", its numeric label is 1.
# We can match the numeric label with the sp name

rownames(finches)[co$sp1]
# Check sp1_name matches numeric label for species.
co[, 'sp1_name'] == rownames(finches)[co$sp1]
co[, 'sp2_name'] == rownames(finches)[co$sp2]

# Columns p_lt and p_gt give us our p-values. If p_lt < 0.05, then spp pair co-occurs at a frequency lower than we would expect to find by chance. If p_gt <- 0.05, the pair co-occurs at a rate hither than we would expect to find by chance. Since we've stored only significant interactions, either p-lt or p_gt will be less than 0.05 for each row.

# How do you visualize this? Plot the co-occurrence networks using 'visNetwork.' 'visNetwork' creates interactive network visualizations using two arguments: a dataframe describing the nodes in the network, and a dataframe describing the edges in the network.

# Start with the nodes data frame. At a min, the nodes df needs an id col to id each node. We'll set our ids to match the numeric labels returned with cooccur (1-13 finch spp). In addition, we'll label our nodes by spp name, specify a color, and add shadow for depth.

# create the df of the nodes in the network
nodes <- data.frame(id = 1:nrow(finches),
                    label = rownames(finches),
                    color = "#606482",
                    shadow = T)

# The edges df needs at least 2 columns, from and to, which should correspond with the ids from the nodes df. Since we used cooccur's numeric labels as our ids, we can use sp1 as our 'from' col and 'sp2' as our to column. (Since our network isn't directed, we could reverse these and it wouldn't matter.) We'll then add some color so our edges match our nodes such that we'll have a lighter color for co-occurrences that occur at a lower frequency than expected and a darker color for co-occurrences that occur at a higher frequency. To make the distinction between 'higher' and 'lower' even more obvious, we'll also specify that co-occurrences that are lower than expected have a dashed line.

# edges df from the significant pairwise co0-occurrences
edges <- data.frame(from = co$sp1, to = co$sp2,
                    color = ifelse(co$p_lt <= 0.05, "lightgreen", "#3C3F51"),
                    dashes = ifelse(co$p_lt <= 0.05, TRUE, FALSE))

# now plot the thing
visNetwork(nodes = nodes, edges = edges) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_kk")

# can it handle all 0 samples or absent spp?
